# üåÄ tl - your own micro-blogging site

Forked by [eapl.me](https://eapl.mx) from [timeline](https://github.com/sorenpeter/timeline)

## üß∂ What is tl?

ActivityPub which is based on Twitter/X is a great micro-blogging platform, although it's implementations (GoToSocial, Mastodon) have an important problem for us, they are difficult and expensive to be self-hosted, and is almost impossible to use a shared hosting.

Our goal is to offer a minimalistic but complete way to host a micro-blogging timeline, which also allows to watch other users timelines, and reply to their messages.

`tl` is a PHP application on top of the a [texudus](https://texudus.readthedocs.io/) file specification to offer a whole micro-blogging experience.

If offers you a space to post texts (twts), images and links to your text feed, as well as following other feeds and engaging in conversations by posting replies.

`tl` also supports Web Mentions as a form of [Linkback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkback), to be notified of `@mentions` from feeds you are not currently following.

At the same time providing a good looking basic design with the help of [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org), which allows you to customize  the look and feel. Even to the level where timeline aligns with the design of your excsing webpage, like I did on: [darch.dk/timeline](https://darch.dk/timeline).

## üõ† Installation and setup

0. You need to have a webhosting with **PHP 8** and perferable running Apache or similar for timeline to work.

	> There are free options, but I would suggest that you pay for your hosting and also get a nice domain, so you have more ownership over your data and online idetenty.

1. Download the code from https://github.com/sorenpeter/timeline as a zip

2. Upload the content of the zip to you webhosting using a FTP client

	- The default would be to put eveything from within the timeline-main folder in the root so you will have:

	```
	www.example.net/timeline/            (go here to see your timeline)
	www.example.net/timeline/gallery/    (go here to see your gallery)
	www.example.net/timeline/post/       (go here to post to your feed)
	www.example.net/twtxt.txt            (where you feed lives and other can follow you)
	www.example.net/avatar.png           (your pretty picture)
	```

	- or you can rename the folder `timeline` to something else

3. Go to the `private` folder and make a copy of `config_template.ini` and save it as `config.ini`

4. Open `config.ini` and edit the setting to you liking and setup

5. Open up `www.example.net/timeline/` in your browser and check for any errors

### Webfinger endpoint setup

6. For allowing others to look you on using webfinger, you need to move the `.well-known` folder from within the `_webfinger_endpoint` to the root of your domain, so it is accesable from www.example.net/.well-know/webfinger

7. You also need to edit the `index.php` file wihtin the `.well-know/webfinger` folder and set the correct path for you timeline installation in `$timeline_dir` variable.


## üé® Customization

- Upload your own `avatar.png` (can also be a .jpg or .gif)
	- Edit your `twtxt.txt` and `config.ini` with the correct path

- Copy `custom_template.css` to `custom.css` and try changinge the coloers to you liking
